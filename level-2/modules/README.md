# Start a new module
A module is a collection of Go packages stored in a file tree with a go.mod file at its root. The go.mod file defines the moduleâ€™s module path, which is also the import path used for the root directory, and its dependency requirements, which are the other modules needed for a successful build. Each dependency requirement is written as a module path and a specific semantic version.
